        <h1>One - Introduction - 2020-12-28</h1>
        <p>
          After a decade of focusing on code as a web application developer, it is time for me to grow in other ways as well.
          For starters, to develop my writing skills I plan to create some small blogposts about what I learned so far, and leave them here.
          Later on I might build a full blown blog, but I wanted to start diary-style to keep it light.

       <h1>Two - On ownership - 2020-12-29</h1>
        <p>
          I spent most of my time so far working for companies that cater to multiple customers.
          At the beginning of my career it was slicing and coding basic websites with the optional contact form, sometimes multiple a week, sometimes even more than one a day!
          Can you imagine? 4 hours between receiving a .psd file and draggin the whole folder into filezilla and hoping for the best... 
          Typically I worked on these projects alone.
          Years later we're talking projects that take multiple months or sometimes years to complete. Typically with 2-4 devs and a project manager.
       <p>
        They are usually not projects but products in disguise. Or even worse, products treated and budgetted as projects. 
       </p>
        <p>
          And there is one big reason for this mess: <strong>The company that codes it, does not own it.</strong>
